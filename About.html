    <p>I started this project as a practice for an online web development course but quickly realized that it could be used as a complement for the pdf resume. The idea behind this resume version is to add some extra information that can't put in the
      pdf because of space. The version 1 of this web resume has the same design as the pdf but with little differences, with the past of the time it might change and has more interactive function and relevant information.
      I have nothing more to say but thank you for taking your time to see this project. Best regards.
