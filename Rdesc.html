    <p>At Reconext I was an electronic technician and did several activities during my stay there, the main activity was to repair card terminals,
      but also I did activities like setting up stations, administrating the material for reparation, check the reparation quality, resolve some problems with technicians and the systems and a several of other activities. Here, thanks
      to my activities, I realized the importance of communication and teamwork because they required a lot of them, I had to communicate with
      technicians, quality inspectors, operators, warehouse staff, and engineering. I learned so much working here. Below is a list of some
      activities:</p>
