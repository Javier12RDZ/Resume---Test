    <p>In Mechatronic Engineering I learned about electronic circuits, control systems, electrical machines, pneumatic and hydraulic systems
      mechanical design, and many other engineering areas, besides a lot of software such as LabVIEW, MATLAB, Multisim, etc. All of This
      throughout eight semesters and a lot of interesting subjects like:</p>
  </div>
  <ul>
    <li>Classic control</li>
    <li>Electronic design</li>
    <li>Robotics</li>
    <li>Materials mechanics</li>
    <li>Electronic Instrumentation</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Even though all subjects were interesting I have some that I liked the most.</p>
  <p>Here is a list of some of my favorite subjects for the bachelor:</p>
  <ul class="listSetting">
    <li class="ListSeparation1"><strong>Programming: </strong> Learned the basics of C++ programming language
    </li>
    <li class="ListSeparation1"><strong>Differential equations: </strong>I used the knowledge that learned in high
      school and the first two semesters of college about calculus to learn new technics and theorems
    </li>
    <li class="ListSeparation1"> <strong>Digital circuits: </strong>In this matter, I learned about digital electronics and boolean logic creating different sequences
      using digital gates and components such as and, or, not and flip flops
    </li>
    <li class="ListSeparation1"> <strong>Introduction to microelectronic manufacturing: </strong> I took this matter in a semibiannual course and saw how to create theoretically a semiconductor device besides how they work</li>
    <li class="ListSeparation1"> <strong>Semiconductors: </strong> This subject is similar to the prior but here I saw more theoretical topics such as crystal structures, quantum physics, and band theory, all to learn in greater depth how
      semiconductor materials work. Worth mentioning this matter was completely online, we had to research different theories in a team of 4. Such a great experience</li>
    <li class="ListSeparation1"> <strong>Automation: </strong> Learned Ladder language and theory of PLC.</li>
    <li class="ListSeparation1"> <strong>Advanced Automation: </strong>Here we learn how to communicate with different electrical or electronic devices using Different communication protocols with and without the internet. In this class, we did a
      team of 4 again and we used Arduino and Python besides communication protocols such as RS232 to achieve communication between devices and create a simple user interface. Another activity that I liked was creating a server with Python.

  </ul>
