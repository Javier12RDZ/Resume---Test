    <p>In Collins Aerospace Iâ€™ve learned technical skills like reading and interpreting electronic schematics, engineering drawings, and BOMs, I must use
      them every day to do my activities besides a piece of diverse equipment such as multimeter, oscilloscope, DC and AC power sources, test panel,
      software, and fixtures. Here I reaffirmed the importance of communication and teamwork as they have been the key to my learning.
      Here are some of my activities as a test technician:</p>
